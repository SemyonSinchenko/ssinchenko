Typically json or yaml files are used. Also for data pipelines, it is sometimes important to be able to write results or state them in a human-readable format. Or serialize some artifacts, like matplotlib plot, into bytes and write them to the disk.\nBut PySpark applications are running in cluster mode, especially in a production environment. And all that we have is some distributed file system or object storage like HDFS, S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.\nRegular approach An obvious solution is of course to use some side library. For example, we can use boto3 for working with S3, pyarrow for working with HDFS, or built-in Pathlib for Local One. But there are some problems:\nSometimes it is a bad idea to take a huge library and add it to the project as a dependency especially if all that we need is just read or write some bytes from/to storage; All of these libraries has own abstractions and interfaces. So each user should learn one more API; Sometimes we need to be able to write into Local Files System when running unit tests but into some cloud storage from production. Of course one can use unittest.mock.patch (or pytest fixtures) but it can make writing tests not a trivial task. At the same moment, we know that PySpark can read and write data quite effectively into any file system. Moreover, spark understands which system is it by path prefix. For example in this code we shouldn't specify the file system, all we need is just write the right prefix:\nspark_data_frame.write.parquet(\"s3a://my-prefix/table\") # this will write to S3 bucket spark_data_frame.write.parquet(\"file://my-home-dir/table\") # and this one will save data locally So why not use such built-in `PySpark` features?\nJava way Spark is written in Scala, a language from the JVM family. And under the hood Spark steel heavily uses org.apache.hadoop so this jar is accessible out-of-the-box in almost each Spark setup. We can make a look into the documentation of org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem: a main class for making i/o operations. There are implementations for S3, HDFS, Local and Azure file storage. So we can use a single interface and all the advantages of Java classes hierarchy and do not care about which implementation to use where. Imagine we have a SparkSession in some Java program. In this case, we can write code like this:\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession; import org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem; import org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { SparkSession spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate(); FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get(spark.sparkContext.hadoopConfiguration); Path oldFile = new Path(\"hdfs://some-place/old-file\"); Path newFile = new Path(\"hdfs://some-place/new-file\"); fs.rename(oldFile, newFile); } } Here we used, for example, method of FileSystem. Generally speaking, we can do any file operation (move, read, write, rename, glob, etc.) with such a class. For Scala users there is also a nice scala library with a simple, functional interface that hide FileSystem under the hood and provides clean public interfaces.\nBut how can we use this solution from PySpark?\nPySpark solution Working with py4j and JVM Interestingly, all the PySpark is built on the shoulders of py4j: a library with 1100 stars in GitHub. Just for comparison spark has 35300 stars on GitHub.\nUnder the hood PySpark just wraps Scala calls into py4j. In spark runtime you have access to JVM:\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() spark_jvm = spark.sparkContext._jvm Let's create some Java objects and try to interact with them from Python.\njava_int = spark_jvm.java.lang.Integer(1) java_another_int = spark_jvm.java.lang.Integer(2) print(java_int + java_another_int) 3 Under the hood py4j implicitly make the conversion from simple Python types into simple Java types. In the example above we pass python int into java.lang.Integer as is. We can do the same things with strings, numbers, and sometimes with lists. But often we should explicitly covert types from python to Java and back.\nCreate a FileSystem instance Let's create a FileSystem instance. From the documentation, we can see that there is a constructor (constructor in Java is like __init__(self, **kwargs) in Python) but it is protected which means it is accessible only from FileSystem class but not from outside. But there are few static methods that allows us to initialize an instance of FileSystem:\nget(Configuration conf) Returns the configured FileSystem implementation. get(URI uri, Configuration conf) Get a FileSystem for this URI's scheme and authority. get(URI uri, Configuration conf, String user) Get a FileSystem instance based on the uri, the passed in configuration and the user. At first, we need to get Configuration conf instance which contains all the information about FileSystem. The good news is that we can get it from our SparkSession object directly from python:\nhadoop_conf = spark._jsc.hadoopConfiguration() Here we are using another object: jsc which is the same SparkContext but accessible not via pyspark wrapper but as JavaObject.\nTo allow spark to choose the right implementation of FileSystem (for example, NativeS3FileSystem for S3 or RawLocalFileSystem for local files) we should pass into get method also URI. To get a URI from a simple path we can use org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path.toUri method:\ndef _get_hdfs( spark: SparkSession, pattern: str ) -\u003e Tuple[JavaObject, JavaObject]: # Java is accessible in runtime only and it is impossible to infer types here hadoop = spark.sparkContext._jvm.org.apache.hadoop # type: ignore hadoop_conf = spark._jsc.hadoopConfiguration() # type: ignore uri = hadoop.fs.Path(pattern).toUri() # type: ignore hdfs = hadoop.fs.FileSystem.get(uri, hadoop_conf) # type: ignore return (hadoop, hdfs) # type: ignore This function gets a spark session and a pattern (or path) and returns us hadoop and FileSystem instance based on the given SparkSession. So if you, for example, already configure your spark session to work with S3 such a function will use this configuration.\nList files The simplest operation we can do with such an instance of FileSystem is to list files in a distributed or local file system. It is sometimes very useful for example if we check if some path exists or to find some directories based on a pattern. There is a method public FileStatus[] globStatus(Path pathPattern) which takes a pattern and returns Java array of FileStatus objects. Let's see how it works:\nhadoop = spark.sparkContext._jvm.org.apache.hadoop # syntax sugar for simplifying the code path = hadoop.fs.Path(\"file:///home/sem/*\") hdfs = hadoop.fs.FileSystem.get(path.toUri(), spark._jsc.hadoopConfiguration()) statuses = file_system.globStatus(path) print(len(statuses)) 105 What happens if we pass a wrong path? hadoop = spark.sparkContext._jvm.org.apache.hadoop # syntax sugar for simplifying the code path = hadoop.fs.Path(\"file://home/sem/*\") hdfs = hadoop.fs.FileSystem.get(path.toUri(), spark._jsc.hadoopConfiguration()) statuses = file_system.globStatus(path) print(len(statuses)) pyspark.sql.utils.IllegalArgumentException: Wrong FS: file://home/sem, expected: file:/// Working with FileStatus To provide a top-level python API we should convert results of globStatus from Java FileStatus[] into python list. To do it lets create a data container for storing information about files:\n@dataclass class HDFSFile: name: str path: str mod_time: int is_dir: bool After that we can loop through statuses and extract information from Java objects to store it inside dataclasses:\nres = [] for file_status in statuses: res.append( HDFSFile( name=file_status.getPath().getName(), path=file_status.getPath().toString(), mod_time=file_status.getModificationTime(), is_dir=file_status.isDirectory(), ) ) Working with strings The next thing we want to have here is the ability to write and read strings. Using just simple strings we can serialize a lot of objects into, for example, json and yaml format. But here we are facing some problems. If we make a look into the documentation of FileSystem we find that the main way to write information is a FSDataOutputStream (link to the documentation). It implements a DataOutputStream abstraction which provides two methods that look interesting from the first view:\npublic final void writeUTF(String str) public final void writeChars(String s) Unfortunately both of them have very bad compatibility with Python UTF-8 strings. The first one uses modified UTF-8 which is useful if you need to have C compatibility but such strings are unreadable from python side (you can read them only as bytes and after that manually decode them). The second one uses UTF-16BE encoding which is some kind of standard in Java but also cannot be simply read as string from Python.\npath = hadoop.fs.Path(\"file:///home/sem/test_file.txt\") output_stream = file_system.create(path) output_stream.writeChars(\"some testing data with utf-8 symbols: абвгдеж😊\") output_stream.flush() output_stream.close() with open(\"/home/sem/test_file.txt\", \"r\") as test_file: print(test_file.read()) (result, consumed) = self._buffer_decode(data, self.errors, final) UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xd8 in position 90: invalid continuation byte Of course, you are still able to read the data as bytes and decode it manually:\nwith open(\"/home/sem/test_file.txt\", \"br\") as byte_file: print(byte_file.read().decode(\"utf-16be\")) some testing data with utf-8 symbols: абвгдеж😊 But it is not the better option. A better way is to write data as bytes on the Java side but read it as regular a string on python side:\ndef write_utf8( hdfs, hadoop, path: str, data: str, mode: Literal[\"a\", \"w\"] ) -\u003e None: \"\"\"Write a given string in UTF-16BE to the given path.

This library contains a lot of useful routines for working with Hive and Hadoop. I pushed the code above into this library so you are free to use it. All that you need is just to write:\nfrom eren import fs hdfs = fs.HadoopFileSystem(spark_session, \"hdfs://some-place\") s3fs = fs.HadoopFileSystem(spark_session, \"s3a://prefix/bucket\") local_fs = fs.HadoopFileSystem(spark_session, \"file://my-home-folder\") ",

Motivation
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Any of us is working with File System in our work. Almost every pipeline or application has some kind of file-based configuration. Typically <code class="verbatim">json</code> or <code class="verbatim">yaml</code> files are used. Also for data pipelines, it is sometimes important to be able to write results or state them in a human-readable format. Or serialize some artifacts, like <code class="verbatim">matplotlib</code> plot, into bytes and write them to the disk.</p>
<p>
But PySpark applications are running in cluster mode, especially in a production environment. And all that we have is some distributed file system or object storage like HDFS, S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-3">
Regular approach
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
An obvious solution is of course to use some side library. For example, we can use <code class="verbatim">boto3</code> for working with <code class="verbatim">S3</code>, <code class="verbatim">pyarrow</code> for working with <code class="verbatim">HDFS</code>, or built-in <code class="verbatim">Pathlib</code> for Local One. But there are some problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes it is a bad idea to take a huge library and add it to the project as a dependency especially if all that we need is just read or write some bytes from/to storage;</li>
<li>All of these libraries has own abstractions and interfaces. So each user should learn one more API;</li>
<li>Sometimes we need to be able to write into Local Files System when running unit tests but into some cloud storage from production. Of course one can use <code class="verbatim">unittest.mock.patch</code> (or <code class="verbatim">pytest</code> fixtures) but it can make writing tests not a trivial task.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the same moment, we know that <code class="verbatim">PySpark</code> can read and write data quite effectively into any file system. Moreover, spark understands which system is it by path prefix. For example in this code we shouldn&#39;t specify the file system, all we need is just write the right prefix:</p>

</div>
<p>
So why not use such built-in `PySpark` features?</p>

<p>
Spark is written in Scala, a language from the JVM family. And under the hood Spark steel heavily uses <code class="verbatim">org.apache.hadoop</code> so this jar is accessible out-of-the-box in almost each Spark setup. We can make a look into the <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileSystem.html">documentation</a> of <code class="verbatim">org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem</code>: a main class for making i/o operations. There are implementations for <code class="verbatim">S3</code>, <code class="verbatim">HDFS</code>, <code class="verbatim">Local</code> and <code class="verbatim">Azure</code> file storage. So we can use a single interface and all the advantages of Java classes hierarchy and do not care about which implementation to use where. Imagine we have a <code class="verbatim">SparkSession</code> in some Java program. In this case, we can write code like this:</p>

<p>
Here we used, for example, <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileSystem.html#rename-org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path-org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path-">method</a> of <code class="verbatim">FileSystem</code>. Generally speaking, we can do any file operation (move, read, write, rename, glob, etc.) with such a class. For <code class="verbatim">Scala</code> users there is also a nice <a href="https://github.com/brayanjuls/hio">scala library</a> with a simple, functional interface that hide <code class="verbatim">FileSystem</code> under the hood and provides clean public interfaces.</p>
<p>
But how can we use this solution from PySpark?</p>

Create a FileSystem instance
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
Let&#39;s create a <code class="verbatim">FileSystem</code> instance. From the documentation, we can see that there is a constructor (constructor in Java is like <code class="verbatim">__init__(self, **kwargs)</code> in Python) but it is <code class="verbatim">protected</code> which means it is accessible only from <code class="verbatim">FileSystem</code> class but not from outside. But there are few <code class="verbatim">static</code> methods that allows us to initialize an instance of <code class="verbatim">FileSystem</code>:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code class="verbatim">get(Configuration conf)</code></td>
<td>Returns the configured FileSystem implementation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="verbatim">get(URI uri, Configuration conf)</code></td>
<td>Get a FileSystem for this URI&#39;s scheme and authority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="verbatim">get(URI uri, Configuration conf, String user)</code></td>
<td>Get a FileSystem instance based on the uri, the passed in configuration and the user.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
At first, we need to get <code class="verbatim">Configuration conf</code> instance which contains all the information about FileSystem. The good news is that we can get it from our <code class="verbatim">SparkSession</code> object directly from python:</p>
<div class="src src-python">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="n">hadoop_conf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">spark</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_jsc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hadoopConfiguration</span><span class="p">()</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Here we are using another object: jsc which is the same SparkContext but accessible not via pyspark wrapper but as JavaObject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To allow spark to choose the right implementation of FileSystem (for example, <code class="verbatim">NativeS3FileSystem</code> for S3 or <code class="verbatim">RawLocalFileSystem</code> for local files) we should pass into <code class="verbatim">get</code> method also <code class="verbatim">URI</code>. To get a <code class="verbatim">URI</code> from a simple path we can use <code class="verbatim">org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path.toUri</code> <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/Path.html#toUri--">method</a>:</p>

This function gets a spark session and a pattern (or path) and returns us hadoop and <code class="verbatim">FileSystem</code> instance based on the given SparkSession. So if you, for example, already configure your spark session to work with S3 such a function will use this configuration.</p>

Working with strings
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
The next thing we want to have here is the ability to write and read strings. Using just simple strings we can serialize a lot of objects into, for example, <code class="verbatim">json</code> and  <code class="verbatim">yaml</code> format. But here we are facing some problems. If we make a look into the documentation of <code class="verbatim">FileSystem</code> we find that the main way to write information is a <code class="verbatim">FSDataOutputStream</code> (<a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FSDataOutputStream.html">link to the documentation</a>). It implements a <code class="verbatim">DataOutputStream</code> abstraction which provides two methods that look interesting from the first view:</p>
<ol>
<li><code class="verbatim">public final void writeUTF(String str)</code></li>
<li><code class="verbatim">public final void writeChars(String s)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately both of them have very bad compatibility with Python UTF-8 strings. The first one uses <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/DataInput.html#modified-utf-8">modified UTF-8</a> which is useful if you need to have <code class="verbatim">C</code> compatibility but such strings are unreadable from python side (you can read them only as bytes and after that manually decode them). The second one uses <code class="verbatim">UTF-16BE</code> encoding which is some kind of standard in Java but also cannot be simply read as string from Python.</p>

</div>
<p>
Of course, you are still able to read the data as bytes and decode it manually:</p>
<div class="src src-python results: output">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">  with open(&#34;/home/sem/test_file.txt&#34;, &#34;br&#34;) as byte_file:

<p>
But it is not the better option. A better way is to write data as bytes on the Java side but read it as regular a string on python side:</p>
